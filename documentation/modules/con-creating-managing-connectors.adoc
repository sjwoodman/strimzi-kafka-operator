= Creating and managing connectors

When you have created a container image for your connector plug-in, you need to create a connector instance in your Kafka Connect cluster. You can then configure, monitor, and manage a running connector instance. For example, you can:

* Check the status of a connector instance
* Increase or decrease the number of tasks for a connector instance
* Restart failed tasks (not supported by the `KafkaConnector` resource)
* Pause a connector instance
* Delete a connector instance

{ProductName} provides two APIs for creating and managing connectors:

* `KafkaConnector` resources (referred to as `KafkaConnectors`)
* Kafka Connect REST API

== `KafkaConnector` resources

`KafkaConnectors` allow you to create and manage connector instances for Kafka Connect in a Kubernetes-native way, so an HTTP client such as cURL is not required.
Like other Kafka resources, you declare a connectorâ€™s desired state in a `KafkaConnector` YAML file that is deployed to your Kubernetes cluster to create the connector instance. 

You manage a running connector instance by updating its corresponding `KafkaConnector`, and then applying the updates. You remove a connector by deleting its corresponding `KafkaConnector`.

To ensure compatibility with earlier versions of {ProductName}, `KafkaConnectors` are disabled by default. To enable them for a Kafka Connect cluster, you must use annotations on the `KafkaConnect` resource. For instructions, see xref:proc-enabling-kafkaconnectors-deployment-configuration-kafka-connect[].

When `KafkaConnectors` are enabled, the Cluster Operator begins to watch for them. It updates the configurations of running connector instances to match the configurations defined in their `KafkaConnectors`.

{ProductName} includes an example `KafkaConnector`, named `examples/connector/source-connector.yaml`. You can use this example to create and manage a `FileStreamSourceConnector`.

== Availability of the Kafka Connect REST API

The Kafka Connect REST API is available on port 8083 as the `<connect-cluster-name>-connect-api` service.

If `KafkaConnectors` are enabled, manual changes made directly using the Kafka Connect REST API are reverted by the Cluster Operator.
